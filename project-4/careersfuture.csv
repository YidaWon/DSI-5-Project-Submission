Reporting of the role This role reports to the Senior Vice President of Xaxis APAC. 3 best things about the job:  Direct and immediate impact to business Extraordinary growth and learning opportunities within APAC and beyond Highly visible position with clients, agencies, and other industry leaders  Measures of success In three months:  Complete understanding of team responsibilities, areas of focus, and engagement across regional and local teams You will have a firm understanding of where Xaxis “data” resides, it’s value, and be able to access it with ease  In six months:  You will become confident in your capabilities and be able to independently support regional and local markets on their requests and problems You will provide input to regional leadership on strategic direction and areas of potential growth & development for the team  In 12 months:  You will become a confident team leader and regional spokesperson for marketing science and insights & analytics to other regional leads You will provide strategic guidance and direction to our client strategy team as it pertains to marketing science and the responsibilities described in this job description  Overview and Responsibilities of the role: The role of Director of Marketing Science will, put simply, ‘make data happen’ for Xaxis APAC – and is a key role given the growth of data-driven marketing, and the key opportunity for programmatic media in this space. The role will involve a combination of “building” our capabilities in the area of data, insights & analytics – to be applied across all countries, teams and clients in APAC – together with directly “executing” these capabilities across our key regional clients.

The small things can make a big difference. The quickest solutions might not be the best. It might take many small steps to get the outcome we ultimately want. ‘Data-driven’, in that you use data for informing everyday decisions (internally), and apply widely to client and campaign solutions (externally). ‘Performance-focussed’ in that you know internal stakeholder, client and agency expectations, and you focus on delivering to these. And you know what makes sense, and what doesn’t, and how to influence. This role will have a broad remit to make best possible use of all available forms of data to improve campaign performance, increase profitability and revenue, and ultimately the value that Xaxis delivers to clients. Of course, the challenge is taking this data and turning it into meaningful insights that can be acted upon in a timely way.

For more information about I2R, please visit www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg We are looking for strong candidates in the field of Artificial intelligence and deep learning, with an interest in working on both fundamental algorithms in large-scale machine learning or deep learning, and also applying it to practical problems in vertical domains. The position, based within the Program in Artificial Intelligence at 12R, entails working closely with a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with training from leading universities like MITI Stanford and CMU. Listed below are problems of interest for this engineering position in the Deep Learning 2.0 project: Multimodal Deep Learning: Towards effective learning from heterogeneous data sources Currently, deep learning is applied in various areas such as visual computing, speech recognition, text mining, etc. in each area, the learning model is trained with large amounts of data in isolation. A multimodal learning approach from heterogeneous data sources, including video, speech, text, etc. is necessary to achieve breakthrough in performance.   Unsupervised Deep Learning: Towards 10X fewer labeled samples Labeling large amounts of training data is one of the most time-consuming steps in the deep learning pipeline, and is often not feasible. The aim is to achieve the same performance with 1.0x fewer labeled training samples. This is a strong step in the direction of unsupervised deep learning, where representations are learnt with large amounts of unlabeled unstructured data,   Deep Learning on Embedded Devices: Towards 1.00X smaller models Current deep learning models have 10s of millions of neurons, making it infeasible for deployment on mobile and embedded hardware. The aim is to achieve models that are 100x smaller, with little loss in performance. This capability will also be critical for emerging neuromorphic platforms, where the number of spiking neurons is orders of magnitude smaller than in current state-of-the-art deep learning models.   Online Deep Learning: Towards Near RealTime (NRT) model updates State-of-the-art deep learning models still take several days to train on expensive GPU infrastructure. A common problem is when new data (including new classes) are constantly added to an evolving, always-learning system. Algorithms to move towards real-time updates will be essential.   Extreme Deep Learning: Training IB neural networks efficiently The high model capacity of deep networks is why increasing amounts of data and model size improves performance. However, there are substantial challenges in hardware and algorithms challenges in training very large models efficiently. The aim is to address these challenges to achieve more efficient training   Deep Learning for Spoken Language Processing and Understanding: Towards better modeling of human communication Language technology has made great advances through deep learning in the past five years, penetrating fields such as speech recognition and machine translation. However, there are still numerous challenges that need to be addressed, ranging from the requirement of specialized linguistic resources to large amounts of annotated data, and to insufficient theoretical grounding in deep learning. This aim attempts to address challenges that are often overlooked by major commercial AI players.   White-Box Deep Learning: Towards interpretable and contextually informed models Current deep learning models are largely black-boxes that are not informed by contextual relations and provide little intuition. Improved abilities to regulate the learning process, and interpret the resulting predictions will be essential for the next wave of AI applications - especially for complex learning scenarios and applications involving critical decisions   Incorporating Knowledge Graphs into Deep Learning: Towards better understanding of Images Current deep learning systems today have no real understanding of images, with output typically a bunch of bounding boxes, learnt using a large number of label or sentence-level associations. Knowledge graphs like the MIT ConceptNet will be used to understand higher level semantics and relationships between entities, to improve classification accuracy.      Requirements   Minimum Bachelor in Computer Science, Statistics, or Data Science intensive fields, with expertise in one or more of the following areas:     Large-scale machine learning Deep learning, supervised or unsupervised Applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to practical problems in different domains   Experience in corporate or application oriented environments is a plus Ability to work independently as well as in teams Good written and communication skills for proposals, reports, and publications Experience with one of the following: Tensor Flow, Theano, Caffe, CNTK Strong programming abilities (e. g.

For more information about I2R, please visit www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg We are looking for strong candidates in the field of Artificial Intelligence and deep learning, with an interest in working on both fundamental algorithms in large-scale machine learning or deep learning, and also applying it to practical problems in vertical domains.  The position entails working closely with a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with training from leading universities at MIT, Stanford and CMU. Listed below are problems of interest in the Deep Leaming 2.0 project:  Multimodal Deep Learning: Towards effective learning from heterogeneous data sources Currently, deep learning is applied in various areas such as visual computing, speech recognition, text mining, etc. In each area, the learning model is trained with large amounts of data in isolation. A multimodal learning approach from heterogeneous data sources, including video, speech, text, etc. is necessary to achieve breakthrough in performance. Unsupervised Deep Learning: Towards 10X fewer labeled samples Labeling large amounts of training data is one of the most time-consuming steps in the deep learning pipeline, and is often not feasible. The aim is to achieve the same performance with !Ox fewer labeled training samples. This is a strong step in the direction of unsupervised deep learning, where representations are learnt with large amounts ofunlabeled unstructured data. Deep Learning on Embedded Devices: Towards 100X smaller models Current deep learning models have 10 s of millions of neurons, making it infeasible for deployment on mobile and embedded hardware. The aim is to achieve models that are I00x smaller, with little loss in performance. This capability will also be critical for emerging neuromorphic platforms, where the number of spiking neurons is orders of magnitude smaller than in current state-of-the-art deep learning models. Online Deep Learning: Towards Near Real Time (NRT) model updates State-of-the-art deep learning models still take several days to train on expensive GPU infrastructure. A common problem is when new data (including new classes) are constantly added to an evolving, always­ learning system. Algorithms to move towards real-time updates will be essential. Extreme Deep Learning: Training lB neural networks efficiently The high model capacity of deep networks is why increasing  amounts of data and model  size improves performance. However, there are substantial challenges in hardware and algorithms challenges in training very large models efficiently. The aim is to address these challenges to achieve more efficient training. Deep Learning for Spoken Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding: Towards better modeling of human communication Language technology has made great advances through deep learning in the past five years, penetrating fields such as speech recognition and machine translation. However, there are still numerous challenges that need to be addressed, ranging from the requirement of specialized linguistic resources to large amounts of annotated data, and to insufficient theoretical grounding in deep learning. This aim attempts to address challenges that are often overlooked by major commercial AI players. White-Box Deep Learning: Towards interpretable and contextually informed models Current deep learning models are largely black-boxes that are not informed by contextual relations and provide little intuition. Improved abilities to regulate the learning process, and interpret the resulting predictions will be essential for the next wave of AI applications -- especially for complex learning scenarios and appl ications involving critical decisions. Incorporating Knowledge Graphs into Deep Learning: Towards better understanding of images Current deep learning systems today have no real understanding of images, with output typically a bunch of  bounding boxes, learnt using a large number of label or sentence-level associations. Knowledge graphs like the MIT ConceptNet will be used to understand higher-level semantics and relationships between  entities,  to improve classification accuracy.  Requirements PhD in Computer Science, Statistics, or Data Science intensive fields, with expertise in one or more of the following areas:      Large-scale machine learning  Deep learning, supervised or unsupervised  Applying state-of-art machine learning techniques to practical problems in different domains   Experience in corporate or application orientated environments is a plus.

Scientist (Deep Learning 2.0)  /  I2R (A*STAR),A*STAR RESEARCH ENTITIES,"UOB PLAZA, 80 RAFFLES PLACE 048624","Contract, Full Time",Professional,Sciences / Laboratory / R&D,"$4,500","$9,000",Monthly,"Roles & ResponsibilitiesAbout the Institute for Infocomm Research (I²R) The Institute for Infocomm Research (I²R) is a member of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) family and is Singapore’s largest ICT research institute. Our strategic thrusts are in the spheres of intelligence, communications and media and our research capabilities are in shared sensor networks, public-public/public-private data-sharing platform, big data analytics and visualization solutions. For more information about I2R, please visit www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg We are looking for strong candidates in the field of Artificial intelligence and deep learning, with an interest in working on both fundamental algorithms in large-scale machine learning or deep learning, and also applying it to practical problems in vertical domains. The position, based within the Program in Artificial Intelligence at I2R, entails working closely with a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with training from leading universities like MIT, Stanford and CMU.  Listed below are problems of interest in the Deep Learning 2.0 project: Multimodal Deep Learning: Towards effective learning from heterogeneous data sources Currently, deep learning is applied in various areas such as visual computing, speech recognition, text mining, etc. In each area, the learning model is trained with large amounts of data in isolation. A multimodal learning approach from heterogeneous data sources, including video, speech, text, etc. is necessary to achieve breakthrough in performance.  Unsupervised Deep Learning: Towards 10X fewer labeled samples Labeling large amounts of training data is one of the most time-consuming steps in the deep learning pipeline, and is often not feasible.  The aim is to achieve the same performance with 10x fewer labeled training samples.  This is a strong step in the direction of unsupervised deep learning, where representations are learnt with large amounts of unlabeled unstructured data. Deep Learning on Embedded Devices: Towards 100X smaller models Current deep learning models have 10s of millions of neurons, making it infeasible for deployment on mobile and embedded hardware.  The aim is to achieve models that are 100x smaller, with little loss in performance. This capability will also be critical for emerging neuromorphic platforms, where the number of spiking neurons is orders of magnitude smaller than in current state-of-the-art deep learning models. Online Deep Learning: Towards Near Real Time (NRT) model updates State-of-the-art deep learning models still take several days to train on expensive GPU infrastructure. A common problem is when new data (including new classes) are constantly added to an evolving, always-learning system.  Algorithms to move towards real-time updates will be essential. Extreme Deep Learning: Training 1B neural networks efficiently The high model capacity of deep networks is why increasing amounts of data and model size improves performance.  However, there are substantial challenges in hardware and algorithms challenges in training very large models efficiently. The aim is to address these challenges to achieve more efficient training. Deep Learning for Spoken Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding: Towards better modeling of human communication Language technology has made great advances through deep learning in the past five years, penetrating fields such as speech recognition and machine translation. However, there are still numerous challenges that need to be addressed, ranging from the requirement of specialized linguistic resources to large amounts of annotated data, and to insufficient theoretical grounding in deep learning. This aim attempts to address challenges that are often overlooked by major commercial AI players. White-Box Deep Learning: Towards interpretable and contextually informed models Current deep learning models are largely black-boxes that are not informed by contextual relations and provide little intuition. Improved abilities to regulate the learning process, and interpret the resulting predictions will be essential for the next wave of AI applications -- especially for complex learning scenarios and applications involving critical decisions. Incorporating Knowledge Graphs into Deep Learning: Towards better understanding of images Current deep learning systems today have no real understanding of images, with output typically a bunch of bounding boxes, learnt using a large number of label or sentence-level associations. Knowledge graphs like the MIT ConceptNet will be used to understand higher-level semantics and relationships between entities, to improve classification accuracy.Requirements PhD in Computer Science, Statistics, Data Science intensive fields with expertise in one or more of the following areas: 	 Large-scale machine learning Deep learning, supervised or unsupervised Applying state-of-art machine learning techniques to practical problems in different domains   Possess PhD experience in corporate or application oriented environments Ability to work independently Team player Experience with Tensor Flow, Theano, Caffe, CNTK skills Strong programming skills in Perl, Bash, C/C++, Java, Python, R, MATLAB Possess computer vision and deep learning skills Good interpersonal and communication skills  The above eligibility criteria are not exhaustive.

Postdoctoral Fellow / Research Associate – Lamina Cribrosa Biomechanics: A Diagnostic Biomarker for Gl,NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE,21 LOWER KENT RIDGE ROAD 119077,"Contract, Full Time",Non-executive,"Education and Training, Engineering","$5,000","$6,500",Monthly,"Roles & ResponsibilitiesJob description: We are looking for a bright, dynamic, and highly motivated individual to perform research in translational biomechanics with applications to ophthalmology. For more information about our Laboratory, please visit: http://www.bioeng.nus.edu.sg/oeil/.   The proposed study aims to assess the biomechanics of the lamina cribrosa (LC) in vivo. The lamina cribrosa (LC), at the back of the eye, provides mechanical supports to the axons that pass through and transmit visual information to the brain. Because the LC is porous, it is mechanically weak, and is the major site of axonal damage in glaucoma – the most common cause of irreversible blindness. Throughout the day and night, the LC is exposed to three major loads: the intraocular pressure (IOP; pushing the LC posteriorly), the cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP; pushing the LC anteriorly), and during eye movements, by the traction from the optic nerve distorting the LC. We believe that excessive and cumulative deformations of the LC from any of these loads could result in glaucomatous axonal damage. We also believe that the biomechanical behaviour of the LC is different between healthy and glaucoma subjects, and that accurate in vivo measurements of LC biomechanics could help us better diagnose glaucoma.   For this project, the successful candidate will use, improve and develop 3D image processing algorithms to assess the biomechanics of the LC in response to changes in IOP, CSFP and gaze position in a large population of normal and glaucoma patients (imaged under various conditions with 3D optical coherence tomography).   The candidate will also assess how information about LC biomechanics could be used to better understand and diagnose glaucoma. This will be done using custom artificial intelligence (deep learning) algorithms in collaboration with the OCTAGON team (http://www.bioeng.nus.edu.sg/OEIL/OCTAGON.html). Finally, the candidate will also be expected to provide assistance while patients are being imaged.   This is a project in collaboration with the Singapore Eye Research Institute (top 5 eye institute worldwide).RequirementsQualification: Excellent programming skills (in C++ and Matlab/Python) and knowledge of 3D image tracking techniques (e.g. digital volume correlation) are required. The candidate is also expected to have a strong foundation in nonlinear continuum mechanics and finite element modeling. Knowledge of the Virtual Fields Method, code parallelization, optical coherence tomography, and deep learning is considered a plus. Hands-on experience in mechanical or biomechanical testing is also considered a plus. No background in ophthalmology is required. Candidates with PhD in Biomedical Engineering, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering, or other related disciplines are encouraged to apply.   Earliest Starting Date: July 2018.   Duration: 3 years.     To apply, please email a detailed CV and the names of two references to:   Dr. Michael JA Girard Ophthalmic Engineering & Innovation Laboratory Department of Biomedical Engineering National University of Singapore Email: jobs@invivobiomechanics.com Homepage: http://www.bioeng.nus.edu.sg/oeil/",https://www.mycareersfuture.sg/job/postdoctoral-fellow-research-associate-%E2%80%93-lamina-cribrosa-biomechanics-diagnostic-biomarker-gl-national-university-singapore-ec0452b751a1b2ce70a14454c16c2bfe
